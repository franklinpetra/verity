Thank you for using this template. It's a configuration to allow a fast startup no matter if its for a prototype
or a production application.

This template should get you started in minutes verses configuring each piece individually.

The technologies this template comes with are: 
- Vite 
- TypeScript
- React 
- Tailwind CSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, 
ESLint rules with Prettier, and Styling with Tailwind CSS in the similar vain to the regular create-vite template.

Currently, two official plugins are available for use with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
